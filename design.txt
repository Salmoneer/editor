callbacks can create panes, open files, create pipelines to run files
should include a terminal and/or an output with no shell

should have separate components:
- buffer editing backend (piece table)
- ui drawing
- input translator accounting for different terminals
- take action on inputs based on lua spec
- lua interpreter including callbacks


execution:
start with just drawing a single buffer in a pane to the screen, editing, and saving
